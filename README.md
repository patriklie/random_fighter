# Random Fighter from Rocky Balboa generator!
***
### The script does the following:
* Has an array of characters from the Rocky Balboa movies.
* Generates two random numbers based on the length of the array. 
* Has a while loop that makes sure it's never the same generated numbers.
* Uses a template literal to implement the fighters into logged strings.
